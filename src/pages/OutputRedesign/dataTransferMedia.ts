It is recommended to configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers correctly when transferring sensitive data to mitigate XSS and data leakage risks.

Firefox supports advanced features such as IndexedDB and Service Workers, which can enhance offline data handling during transfer operations. For large file transfers, developers may leverage the Streams API or WebSocket protocol for continuous data flow. It is essential to configure CORS headers correctly on the server to ensure Firefox accepts and processes cross-domain requests without error.

Outlook must be connected to an authenticated Microsoft 365 or Exchange account, and the user must have appropriate permissions to read or write mailbox contents. For exporting or sending attachments, MIME encoding standards must be followed to ensure compatibility across email clients. Additionally, if interacting with Outlook via desktop applications, make sure the local security settings and macro policies allow execution of relevant scripts or integrations.
